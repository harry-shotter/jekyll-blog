## Template Areas
CSS Grid Layout has been a gamechanger for me, it's simple, quick, very effective, and supported by all major browsers. So, I thought I'd write a quick guide showing how easy it is to setup a standard page using grids, particularly grid template areas. 

Firstly though, browser support: 

| Chrome - | Firefox - | Edge - | Safari - | IE 11 |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 57       | 52        | 16     | 10       | ðŸ˜•   |

While you can add IE compatibility through some polyfills, I won't be going into that for this post.

## What is CSS Grid Layout?
Before I get into the specifics of template areas, here's a quick overview of CSS Grid from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp): _"The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning."_

Here's an example of a basic 2x2 grid layout:

{% highlight html %}
<style>
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        height: 200px;
        width: 200px;
    }
    .container div {
        border: 1px solid red;

    }
</style>
<div class="container">
    <div>
        #1
    </div>
    <div>
        #2
    </div>
    <div>
        #3
    </div>
    <div>
        #4
    </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

That, creates this:

![basic grid]({{ "/assets/images/posts/css-grid-template-areas/basic-grid.png" | relative_url }})
Easy!

## Standard Web Layout
When using Template Areas for more complex pages this syntax becomes even easier to understand in my opinion; I personally like the visual aspect of seeing named areas rather than the usual `grid-row: 1 / span 2` etc. syntax  

So, here's the layout I'm going to be creating:

![basic grid]({{ "/assets/images/posts/css-grid-template-areas/page-layout.png" | relative_url }})

You can see this is split into 5 main sections: Nav, Header, Main, Side, and Footer. I'd say this is typical of a website layout and one that could be awkward to implement using the usual CSS tricks.

This is how simple it is with CSS Grid & Template Areas: 

{% highlight html %}
<style>
    .container {
        display: grid;

        grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 100px;
        grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 300px;
        grid-template-areas: "nav header header"
                             "nav main side"
                             "nav footer footer";

        grid-gap: 10px;
    }

    nav {
        grid-area: nav;
    }

    header {
        grid-area: header;
    }

    article {
        grid-area: main;
    }

    aside {
        grid-area: side;
    }

    footer {
        grid-area: footer;
    }
</style>

<div class="container">
    <nav> nav </nav>
    <header> header </header>
    <article> main </article>
    <aside> side </aside>
    <footer> footer </footer>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
 
Let's break the CSS down, the first line `display: grid;` tells the browser that this div and its children will be using a grid layout (specifically a block level grid). Next, we have the grid definition which can be split into two parts: defining the row and column sizes and, defining the grid areas.

Looking at the row and column definitions:

{% highlight css %}
    grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 100px;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 300px;
{% endhighlight %}

This is creating 3 rows and 3 columns, all different sizes. By using `1fr` we're telling the browser that this row/column should take up 1 fraction of the remaining space; in this case that would be all remaining space. If we had defined a row `1fr 1fr 1fr` it would create 3 evenly distributed rows.

Next, the template area definition: 

{% highlight css %}
    grid-template-areas: "nav header header"
                         "nav main side"
                         "nav footer footer";
{% endhighlight %}

This is visually mapping where each section of our page will fit in the previously defined grid. Each string is a single row; the first row `"nav header header"` is stating that the first column will be taken by the `nav` area and the last two columns will be used by the `header` area, the second row being `"nav main side"` is stating that the `nav` area will continue to the second row and the `main` and `side` areas will take up one cell each. 

I've chucked a `grid-gap: 10px;` in there to help with the layout, this just adds some space between each cell.

Lastly, we assign our items on our page to the grid areas using the `grid-area: <name>` property.

{% highlight css %}
    article {
        grid-area: main;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

And with a little extra work you can start populating the page with your page information.

### Responsive design
Just a little side note here: CSS Grid is responsive! With a few media tags you can adjust the number of columns/rows and create a nice mobile friendly layout, for example: 

{% highlight css %}
.container {
    display: grid;
    height: 90%;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px 1fr 200px 100px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: "nav" "header" "main" "side" "footer";
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 100px;
        grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 300px;
        grid-template-areas: "nav header header" "nav main side" "nav footer footer";
        grid-gap: 10px;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Go and play!
While I haven't gone into great detail regarding CSS Grid and all of its possibilities, I hope this has been helpful in showing you just how much it can help you when designing a web page and motivated you to start using CSS grid. Once I've got to grips with the polfills to support IE 11 ðŸ™„, I will be using this a lot more.
